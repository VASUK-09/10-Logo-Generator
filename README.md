# Logo Generator Command Line Tool

This command-line tool is designed for freelance web developers who want to generate a simple logo for their projects without having to pay a graphic designer. The tool allows you to enter up to three characters, choose a text color, select a shape from a list of options, and choose a shape color. Once you have entered all the information, an SVG file named logo.svg will be created, and the output text "Generated logo.svg" will be printed in the command line.
